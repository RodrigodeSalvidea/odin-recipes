    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Bacon and eggs are a timeless combination, having survived the dark days of dietary cholesterol demonization 
        and coming back as reasonably complete, fairly nutritious breakfast to be enjoyed every once in a while. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Both eggs and bacon can be cooked in almost whatever way and still taste at least ok. I think over medium is the way to go 
        for eggs, so that you can combine the runny yolk with the bacon and avoid any mucusy white, but anything goes.
